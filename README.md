# ESH

My own attempt at recreating a shell in c, referencing tokenrove's [Build Your Own Shell](https://github.com/tokenrove/build-your-own-shell).

This shell is primitive, with no scripting or support for operators. My objective with this project is to learn some fundamentals about shells and their relationship to the operating system.

I probably should have picked python instead of c to build this program, but the lower level nature of the language has been helpful in understanding how processes relate to things like the main() function.
